The first part of the development process I considered was different ways I could create my tree. There seemed to be two main
way I could do this either using the Lindenmayer systemas a way to create a fractal like tree which I played around with trying to create
the desired effect but was unhappy with the results. I considered the second way of using a recursive function. I used this altering
the branches lengths, angles and depth until I was happy with the result.

When creating the rain, I had to code that separately in a new project as I was having troubles getting anything else to generate on my
main project due to the tree being static. So, to be sure I was coding the rain correctly a new project seemed the best way to see if I
could create it. I started by creating a single rain drop and putting it into an array to create many more. I started to alter
the positions and speed of the drops with some random positions and speed. Trying to create a depth effect I mapped a Z axis to the
drops trying to make the drops in the back look smaller and appear slower.

Trying to add the two codes to one project was where most of the issues stemmed from. I tried to just combine the two sets of code but was
unable to get anything to generate. I tried to add the display branches function into the setup so that it was only called once, hoping that
the rain could generate over it but it didn't work. I found a function called createGraphics() that would create somewhat of a "second
canvas" I tried to apply my tree code into there but struggled to figure out what exactly was needed and couldn't get it to display properly.

In the end due to these difficulties I had to simplify my project by letting my tree generate a new version every frame, this allowed my rain
to also generate. Although not the way I wanted from generating offscreen and falling, it seemed to have its position related
to the tree which I was unable to fix.
